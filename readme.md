ðŸš€ Features
âœ” Deepfake Detection - Uses AI to distinguish between real and AI-generated voices.
âœ” Audio Watermarking - Embeds an imperceptible watermark for tracking.
âœ” Noise Visualization - Displays differences between original and watermarked audio.
âœ” User-Friendly UI - Web-based interface for easy upload and analysis.
